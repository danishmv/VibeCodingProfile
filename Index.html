          Vibe Coding is a friendly way of building digital products—websites,
          mobile apps, and small tools—where both technical and non-technical
          people can collaborate, experiment, and ship ideas quickly.

      <h2 id="about-title" style="display:none;">About Vibe Coding</h2>
      <p>
        Vibe Coding is a way of thinking about software where the focus is on
        clarity, collaboration, and creativity. Instead of getting lost in
        complex setups, you use a simple environment and smart tools so that
        ideas can move from your head to the screen as smoothly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you come from a strong technical background or you are just
        starting out, Vibe Coding encourages you to break work into small steps,
        experiment safely, and learn as you build. It’s about finding a “flow”
        that matches your style and pace, while still following good coding
        practices.

      <h2>Benefits of Vibe Coding</h2>
      <div class="grid three-col">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Clear Structure</h3>
          <p>
            Your projects are organized into simple sections—such as pages,
            components, and styles—so it’s easy to understand and maintain.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Fast Iteration</h3>
          <p>
            With AI-powered suggestions and reusable patterns, you can try new
            ideas quickly, refine them, and see results instantly in the browser
            or emulator.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Collaborative</h3>
          <p>
            Technical and non-technical teammates can share prompts, review
            code together, and adjust content without needing to know every
            detail of the underlying system.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Learning by Building</h3>
          <p>
            Through small, focused projects, you build real skills while
            actually shipping useful things, instead of only following
            abstract tutorials.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Reusable Patterns</h3>
          <p>
            Once you create a layout, a component, or a template, you can reuse
            it across multiple projects to stay consistent and save time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Scales with You</h3>
          <p>
            You can start with very simple projects and gradually evolve into
            more advanced websites and applications as your comfort and skills
            grow.

      <h2>Get Started with Vibe Coding Using VS Code &amp; GitHub Copilot</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        This tab is your guided path to begin Vibe Coding with a simple,
        practical workflow. You only need a few tools, and you can start with
        small experiments before moving to full projects.

      <div class="grid two-col">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Step 1: Set Up Your Environment</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Install Visual Studio Code on your computer.</li>
            <li>Create or sign in to your GitHub account.</li>
            <li>Install the GitHub Copilot extension inside VS Code.</li>
            <li>Create a new folder for your first Vibe Coding project.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Step 2: Start a Simple Web Project</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Create an <code>index.html</code> and a <code>styles.css</code> file.</li>
            <li>
              Open a blank section and write a natural-language comment describing
              what you want (e.g., “Create a hero section with a title, subtitle,
              and button”).
            </li>
            <li>
              Let your AI coding assistant suggest code, then review and adjust it
              to match your style.

            <li>Pick one small idea: a landing page, a portfolio, or a simple app.</li>
            <li>Break it into sections: header, content, footer, and interactions.</li>
            <li>
              Use prompts to ask your AI assistant for each section separately,
              so the project stays organized and understandable.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

            <li>Deploy your website using a static hosting platform.</li>
            <li>Invite friends or colleagues to view and test your project.</li>
